The App does not collect any information directly. Information relating to your
use of the App may be shared with the Developer by Apple, Inc. (**Apple**) if
you consent to submit diagnostic information to third-party developers.

Information relating to your use of the App may be collected if you agree to
participate in the testing of versions of the App that have not been publicly
released. An example of this is if you agree to test the App using Apple's
TestFlight service.

#### GitHub

The source code to the App is made available through a code-hosting service
(the **Repository**) operated by GitHub, Inc. (**GitHub**). The Developer also
uses the Repository to collect reports on errors relating to the App.

Any information received or collected by the Developer as a result of your use
of the Repository will be subject to the Policy. However, information received
or collected by GitHub is not subject to the terms of the Policy. GitHub's
privacy policy is available on [their website](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement).

rights or defend against legal claims; (c) to investigate, prevent, or take

the Developer's policies; or (d) to protect the Developer's rights and property.

In the future, the Developer may sell to, buy, merge with, or partner with
other entities. In such transactions, information collected or received may be
among the transferred assets.
