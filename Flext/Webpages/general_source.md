The source code for Flext is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pyrmont/flext).
The code is made available under a modified form of the BSD-3 licence.

## Rationale

Making software open source is sometimes considered inconsistent with commercial
distribution of that software. Flext challenges this orthodoxy.

Making Flext open source has three benefits:

1. **It gives users confidence.** In a situation where Flext is no longer being
   developed, you know that you have the ability to take the code, make
   modifications and share those back with others. Even if Flext is under active
   development, I might decline to implement a feature you'd like to see in the
   app. An open source project allows users to actively contribute improvements.

2. **It helps learners.** I began learning how to program by viewing the source
   of webpages that did things I didn't know were possible. In a world of
   closed-source apps, users who see something interesting can't do the same and
   that's a shame. I don't actually think Flext does anything that innovative
   but you never know.

3. **It helps me.** Flext is my first iOS app and I'm sure I'm doing things
   incorrectly. I hope that by making my work available for others to use and
   benefit from, I encourage more experienced developers to spend the time to
   correct mistakes they see. Knowing your work is going to be public also gives
   me incentive to try to write better code.

## Approach

Flext's source code is licensed under a modified form of the liberal BSD-3
licence. This permits licensees to modify and distribute the software, including
for commercial use. In other words, you can, if you'd like, take the source
code, compile it into your own app and submit it to the App Store.

The one caveat is that the licence does not grant any rights in the 'FLEXT' mark
or in the 'FLEXT LOGO' mark. Files that include these marks can remain in the
repository but they cannot be used for marketing or commercial purposes.

In other words, you can use the source of Flext to make a competing app; you
just can't put it in the App Store and call it 'Flext' or use the Flext logo.
I believe this prevents confusion for customers who are looking for Flext while
still encouraging competition.
