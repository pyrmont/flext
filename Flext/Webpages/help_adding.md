# Adding Processors

You can add your own processors to extend the functionality of Flext. Processors are
JavaScript files that manipulate strings of text.

## Importing

To import a JavaScript file:

1. in the Editor, tap the **gear icon** to go to Settings;
2. in Settings, tap on **Processors** in the Management section;
3. in Processors, tap on **Add** at the bottom right of the screen; and
4. find and tap **your JavaScript file** using the file browser that appears.

If your JavaScript contains a valid processor, Flext will import the file. The processor will
appear at the end of the list of enabled processors.

Flext gives unique identifiers to every file you import. This means you can import a file with the
same name a previously imported file.

## Renaming

When Flext imports a processor, it uses the name of the imported file for the processor name.
You can change this name at any time.

To rename a user-added processor:

1. in the Editor, tap the **gear icon** to go to Settings;
2. in Settings, tap on **Processors** in the Management section;
3. in Processors, scroll to the **User-Added Processors** section;
4. tap on the **name** of the processor you want to rename and type in your new name.

The name of a user-added processor cannot be blank.
